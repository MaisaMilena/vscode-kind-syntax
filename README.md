# Syntax highlight for the Kind Language

This extension is available on VSCode [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaisaMilena.kind) to highlight code written in Kind language.

It was created using [Iro](https://eeyo.io/iro/), and I recommend it to create simple highlights as I did to color symbols and names.

### How to use Iro
1. Open Iro and paste the code in `iro_syntax.txt`
2. You can update the code, run and test it using my test code (`iro_test_file.kind`) that uses `kind-lang@1.0.4`
3. Copy that code in `Textmate` tab and paste it into your extension `<language>.tmLanguage.plist` file.

To publish an extension check out the Microsoft [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension).
